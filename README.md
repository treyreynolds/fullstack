# Trey's Full Stack Technology Demo

This is a technology demo which brings together a wide variety of languages, frameworks, and
techniques.

### Dependencies

  - MongoDB running on the standard port (27017)
  - NodeJS (currently tested up to Node v5.10.0)

Everything you need to know to get up and running with MongoDB can be found here:
[docs.mongodb.org](https://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/installation/)

### Installation

Clone the repository and run NPM install

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/treyreynolds/holdem-bot holdem-bot
```

```sh
$ cd fullstack
$ npm install
```

Make sure MongoDB is running (in another terminal)
```sh
$ mongod
```

### Run the App

We have a small shell script that should help you get the app up and running. If you're ambitious go out and get yourself a gulp or grunt script up and running on this bad boy. If you're not ambitious, you'll just do this:

```sh
$ ./bin/www
```
